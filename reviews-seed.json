The bouncer I originally thought of, sadly was booked up but thankfully he has such a wide variety of options! He was so generous and came to measure our yard because I feared our small yard couldn't accommodate a bigger bounce house - but thankfully I was wrong! 😂 he even recommended a better option based on age group and heat index! The kids had such an amazing time and it will forever be a core memory. I actually reached out to Chris a few hours before or origin pickup time and was able to schedule more time because of how much of a hit it was! His flexibility, communication, and inventory is TOP NOTCH. Didn't even require a deposit up front which I really appreciated after being burned by other companies. Recommend 100% to anyone looking to rent in the future.",

    "text": "Only a week before the 4th of July, I reached out to see if there were any rentals available. Chris responded quickly and locked in the slide we wanted and gave us a generous amount of time for the rental. The day of the party, he helped point out where the best place to set up was and got the slide up quickly. Even with all the rentals during the busy holiday, he made sure we were set up safely and set our expectations high before leaving. We finished earlier than planned and Chris was able to come sooner to start packing up. Having used rentals before that required us to pickup, setup, pack, and return all in the same day made SATX Bounce’s delivery and pickup service model so much better. Chris has phenomenal customer service, quick response time, and was available for any questions before, during, and after our rental. Everyone loved the slide and the service provided by Chris made it easy for me as the renter. I have no hesitations renting again from Chris and he has set the bar extremely high!",

    "text": "Working with Chris and SA Bounce was the easiest process.  I found them by pure luck and I am so happy I did.  He responded to my inquiry on line right away. Unfortunately, we had to reschedule our birthday party due to weather but it was no problem for Chris. Once we had our party, he showed up on time. Him and his wife are very pleasant and super fast setting everything up.  The bounce house was clean and smelled fresh!!  Not like feet or sweat like some can. The kids had a blast and the adult kids had just as much fun in it too!!  When it came time for pick up, once again he was on time and take down was just as fast.  We will 100% be renting from them again and HIGHLY recommend them!!",
